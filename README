# Overview

This is container image created for IUF operations. The following tools are installed in this container image:

- loftsman-manifest-upload
- s3-upload

# Dependencies

Note that this container image requires the following dependencies but does not embed them:

- craycli
- loftsman
- manifestgen
- git
- jq

It is expected that all these dependencies will be mounted from host, and the $PATH inside the container will be appended to include
the mounted host directory containing these dependencies, before using any of the tools provided within this container.

Furthermore, note that the host's /usr/bin directory is already mounted as part of the [iufBase.template](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/cray-nls/blob/0597b3fb49c966d260fac173b82bd224a3467af3/src/api/argo-templates/base/iufBase.template.argo.yaml#L72),
as well as appended to the PATH inside the container, so if you are writing an IUF operation that uses the iufBase.template, then you don't have to do anything.
